/*
 * The fixture source still renders unchanged — byte for byte — and the live
 * source renders the same bytes from the same game.
 *
 * ## The baseline
 *
 * Re-recorded in Wave 20 at `dcb2e60` (§A: the battlefield grouped into
 * `data-board-row` rows with a gutter and a reset control, and the faces moved
 * to the ends). Before that, in Wave 19 (Board gained faces, fixed zones and
 * stack art: 5c42535, 48d8266). `BASELINE_SHA256` / `BASELINE_LENGTH` are the static markup of
 * `<Board view={boardFromFixture(PLAY_FIXTURES[0])} />`, recorded at commit
 * 2709447 — Wave 9's base, BEFORE this lane touched `../adapter.ts` or added
 * anything under `live/`. If this test fails, the fixture path renders
 * differently than it did before the live source existed, which is precisely
 * the regression the fixture exists to catch. If the change is intended (a
 * deliberate Board or adapter change in a later wave), re-record both numbers
 * from the failure message and say so in that commit.
 *
 * `Board.test.ts` and `fold.test.ts` are the finer-grained net and are not
 * modified by this lane; this is the coarse one that sees every byte.
 *
 * **It renders `Board` and nothing else**, so a failure here is a change to
 * `../Board.tsx`, `../adapter.ts` or `../fixtures.ts` — never to anything under
 * `live/`. Re-recording the two numbers belongs with the commit that makes the
 * markup change — or, when that commit does not own this file, immediately
 * after it, naming it (as the paragraph above does for `dcb2e60`).
